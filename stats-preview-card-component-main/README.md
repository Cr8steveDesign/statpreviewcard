# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [Stats preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

Thank you or looking through my project. It is yet another opportunity to practice and ofcourse learn new tweaks and tips to make the design as pixel perfect as possible as well as maintaining accessibility. This is my second project on FrontEndMentor. I'm looking forward to getting workable knowledge in Java Script, so I can attempt the more exciting challenges I'm seeing on the site.

Feel free to share your comments about what I can do to learn more and improving my HTML and CSS....especially as regards Accessibility. I picked up some points from my last submission on another challenge to work on html structure.
